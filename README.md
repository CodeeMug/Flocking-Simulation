# Flocking-Simulation
This is a simple 2D simulation of a "Boid" flock, this creatures follow three simple rules 
(alignment, cohesion, separation), that when combined create a natural looking simulation. This 
project was made in JavaScript with the library P5.js

> Boid.js

       Store the boid class.
       
> sketch.js 

      Store the code that runs the simulation
